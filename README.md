### Tiny Django

I've come to love django for rapid prototyping. However, I always feel that the initial structure for django apps is too complex for a fast micro service.

This repo represents a fully functional setup with a minimal footprint.

Configuration and route setup is done in `app.py` and there is an app `app` with some django models.

#### what is to come

I also often use:

- `django_channels`.
- `drf_spectacular`
- `rest_framework`
- `celery`
- `nextjs` (for frontends)

I'm going to be adding minimal setups for all of these.

This shall become a one click setup for a minimal feature rich django setup aimed at rapid prototying.
